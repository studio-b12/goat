## Recommended Setup

We are using and recommending the following setup for your Goatfiles.

```
integrationtests/
  tests/
    route-1/
      feature-1/
        _framework.goat
        tests.goat
      feature-2/
        tests.goat
  util/
    _login.goat
  params.yml
```

We are using a directory `integrationtets` at the top of our repositories. In the `util` directory, we put Goatfiles which have a general purpose and are used by a lot of test Goatfiles. For example login and logout procedures. Goatfiles which start with an underscore (`_`) are excluded when you execute goat on a directory. The `tests` directory contains all the actual test cases, split up into routes and features. The `_framework.goat` file contains the setup and teardown procedures for that specific test case and is used by `tests.goat`. Also, we put our `params.yml` in there which contains developer and instance specific parameters which need to be set for the test execution. This file is gitignored and will not be commited to the repository though.

With this setup, the test execution is as simple as using the following command to execute all test suits.
```
goat integrationtests/ -p integrationtests/params.yml
```
